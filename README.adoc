= NativeSVG

A pure Julia SVG generator. Using `do` blocks and keyword arguments, a one-to-one mapping is implemented between the HTML standard and Julia.

```julia
html() do
    head() do
        title("Hello, World!")
    end
    body() do
        div() do
            span("Hello", style="color:red;")
            text(",")
            b("World!")
        end
    end
end
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <title>Hello, World!</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <div>
   <span style="color:red;">Hello</span>
   , 
   <b>World!</b>
  </div>
 </body>
</html>
```
